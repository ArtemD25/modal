# modal
The purpose was to practice following tasks:
- to close / open any number of modal windows always using the same script without adding new one (amending the previous one);
- to close modal window:
--- by clicking on the red close-button of the modal window itself;
--- by pressing the escape key on the keyboard;
--- or by clicking on the "grey background";
- an additional task as it occurred later was to prevent modal windows from closing by clicking on the modal window itself (according to the HTML-code the modal window is the "grey background"`s child).
